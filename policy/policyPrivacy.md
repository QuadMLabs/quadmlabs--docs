# Privacy Policy – QuadMLabs Apps for Atlassian

*Last updated: 21/11/2025*

QuadMLabs ("we", "our", "us") develops applications for Atlassian products, including Jira and Confluence.  
This Privacy Policy explains what information our apps collect, how we use it, and your rights as a user.

## 1. Information We Collect
    **1.1. No Personal Data Collected**
        Our applications do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about users.  
        All processing happens within the Atlassian product and remains fully inside the customer’s environment.

    **1.2. Data Accessed Only for Functionality**
        Our apps may access certain issue fields, project metadata, or configuration data strictly to provide the functionality of the app.  
        This data is never stored outside Atlassian nor transmitted to external servers.

    **1.3. Logs and Diagnostics**
        We do not collect or store logs containing user-identifiable information.  
        Any diagnostics are managed by Atlassian Forge infrastructure.

## 2. How We Use Data

The data accessed by the app is used only to:

    - Display information inside Jira or Confluence
    - Generate calculated results
    - Support the functionality requested by the user

We do not sell, share, or export your data.

---

## 3. Data Storage

Our apps run on the Atlassian Forge platform.  
All storage, if used, is inside the Forge secure storage within Atlassian Cloud.  
No external servers or databases are used.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not share data with:

    - Third parties
    - External services
    - Advertising or analytics platforms

Your data remains solely within Atlassian Cloud.

---

## 5. Security

We rely on Atlassian Forge’s secure architecture, which includes:

    - Encrypted storage
    - Sandboxed execution
    - Zero external data access by default

We follow best practices for app security and do not process any personal user information.

---

## 6. User Rights

Since we do not store personal data, rights such as access, deletion, or portability are intrinsic — no personal data exists outside your Atlassian instance.
