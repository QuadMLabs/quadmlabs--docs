# 🛠️ Atlassian Development & Automation

**Custom solutions using Groovy, Java, Forge Custom UI, JavaScript, React**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Beyond my work as an Atlassian Administrator, I’ve developed **custom technical solutions** that extend Jira and Confluence beyond their native capabilities.
This includes scripting, automations, integrations, data processing, and full application development—bridging the gap between **administration and engineering.**

---

## 🧩 Key Development Skills

**🐍 Groovy Development (ScriptRunner)**

    - Behaviors for dynamic form logic
    - Custom validations & conditions
    - Post-functions for automation at workflow level
    - Object manipulation & relationships in Assets
    - Script Console utilities & reusable helpers
    - REST API integrations (internal & external systems)

**🌐 REST Integrations**

    - Endpoints for Jira & Confluence (Cloud + DC when applicable)
    - Methods for authentication, pagination & error handling
    - Custom data retrieval for reporting or automation
    - Two-way sync logic for cross-system operations

**📦 Confluence Automation (Java + Spring Boot)**

One of my most impactful developments:

    - Automated identification and extraction of images across spaces
    - Structural processing (naming, folders, hierarchies)
    - Automatic migration into new spaces
    - Standardization of content & significant time savings

This solution replaced manual, error-prone tasks with a repeatable and scalable automation.

**🧱 Atlassian Forge & Custom UI**

Participation in building an enterprise-level Forge application:

    - React-based Custom UI components
    - Client-side logic & event-driven workflows
    - Deep understanding of Forge architecture & permission model
    - Integration with internal APIs and Jira endpoints

This experience strengthened my ability to design Atlassian Cloud applications end-to-end.

## 🎯 Impact on My Professional Profile

These developments shaped me into a **hybrid administrator–developer**, allowing me to:

    - Diagnose technical problems quickly
    - Design scalable customizations
    - Understand architectural implications of changes
    - Build tooling when native features aren’t enough
    - Support teams needing Dev + Admin expertise

This foundation also enabled me to develop **my own personal Jira application**, fully documented in the *Documentation* section of this portfolio.

## 📌 Current Scope

I continue to evolve in:

    - Groovy scripting for Jira
    - Forge app development
    - Integrations and automation architecture
    - Custom UI experiences for Atlassian Cloud
