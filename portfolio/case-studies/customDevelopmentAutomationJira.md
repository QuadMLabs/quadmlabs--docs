# Custom Development and Automation for Jira

Throughout my career, I complemented my responsibilities as a Jira Administrator by developing custom solutions that extended the platform's native capabilities. This allowed me to optimize processes, create bespoke functionalities, and address needs that couldn't be met with standard configurations alone.

**Notable Solutions and Developments**

    - **Technical Automation with Groovy and Jira Assets**
    
        I began by developing basic Groovy scripts to consume, relate, and transform objects within Assets, facilitating information management and traceability across projects and teams.

    - **Groovy Scripts for Behaviors, Validations, and Post-Functions**
        
        I implemented multiple behaviors, conditions, validations, and post-functions that improved workflow quality, automated repetitive tasks, and ensured data consistency at the project and organizational levels.

    - **Advanced REST API Consumption with Groovy**

        I designed reusable methods to interact with the APIs of Jira, Confluence, and external systems, enabling custom integrations, process automation, and the generation of consolidated information for reporting.

    - **Automated Image Migration in Confluence (Java + Spring Boot)**

        I developed a method that read images from one space in Confluence, processed their structure (names, directories, hierarchies), and migrated them to another space. This solution standardized content, prevented inconsistencies, and significantly reduced operational times.

    - **Participation in the Development of an Enterprise Application (Forge + Custom UI)**

        I was part of the development of an enterprise application based on Atlassian Forge, working with Custom UI and JavaScript to build custom interfaces and client-side logic. This experience strengthened my understanding of the Atlassian Cloud ecosystem at both a technical and architectural level.

**Impact on my professional profile**

These experiences solidified a hybrid perspective between development and administration, which I now apply to solve complex problems, guide technical decisions, and create scalable solutions.

Furthermore, this technical path is the foundation that led me to design and build my own personal application for Jira, the development and documentation of which are part of this portfolio `(Documentation section)`.
