# Specialized Support in the Atlassian Ecosystem

## Context

I provide specialized technical support for Jira Service Management (JSM), Jira Software, Confluence, and third-party applications such as Xray and Scriptrunner, among others. I handle incidents and requests originating from the JSM portal with a technical, functional, and user-oriented approach.

My experience includes resolving `over 8,500 tickets, ranking #1 on the team in volume of resolved cases`, which reflects consistency, efficiency, and a deep understanding of the Atlassian ecosystem.

When a case requires more detail, I coordinate calls or direct sessions with the client, which facilitates understanding the context, reproducing the problem in real time, and offering more precise and faster solutions.

## Technical and Specialized Knowledge

My support role requires a complete understanding of the Atlassian ecosystem. Unlike a one-off implementation, here the responsibility lies in knowing **every process, every integration, and every tool** to diagnose and resolve real-world production issues.

Below, I detail my specific technical capabilities in this context:

- **Jira Software and Jira Core (Advanced Administration)**

    - Management of complex schemas (workflows, screens, schemes, issue types) used in multiple internal processes.
    - Advanced configuration and management of boards, including complex filters, permissions, dynamic columns, and project dependencies.
    - In-depth knowledge of advanced JQL, combined with:
        - PQL (Projectrack Query Language) for queries between issues and projects.
        - AQL (Assets Query Language) for dynamic filtering of objects and relationships.
    - Advanced queries with tools like Xray (e.g., Test Plans → Tests → Executions).
    - Configuration of:
        - Complex Issue Security Schemes.
        - Internal and public Issue Collectors.
        - Administrative, analytical, and operational dashboards.

- **Import Management (Issues, Tests, Asset Objects, and Structured Data)**

    - **Bulk Import of Issues (CSV)**

        - Adjustment and correction of complex mappings, custom fields, references between issues, dependent values, validation rules, and special formats.
    
    - **Import of Tests in Xray**

        - Import of Tests, Test Sets, Test Executions, and Test Plans via CSV or compatible structures.
        - Correction and normalization of poorly constructed client files (encoding errors, separators, missing fields, invalid sequences).

    - **Advanced Imports in Assets (JSM)**

        - Data Mapping configuration for JSON, CSV, and external sources.
        - Transformation and adjustment of JSON files to comply with hierarchical structures, parent-child relationships, references between        objects, and dependent attributes.
        - Creation of Object Type Mappings, update rules, duplicate handling, and cross-reference control.
        - Incremental and full-sync imports according to the required strategy.
        - Diagnosing import errors using asset logs, validation AQLs, and tests on development schemas.

    - **Correction of files submitted by clients**

        - Identification and repair of common errors:
        - Incorrect coding
        - Inconsistencies in foreign keys
        - Incorrect delimiters
        - Invalid dates
        - Broken JSON structures
        - Poorly defined relationships between objects
    
    - **Guided client support to ensure clean, consistent, and maintainable imports**

- **Diagnostics and Troubleshooting**

    - Analysis of issue history, audit logs, and workflow traces.
    - Reading and analyzing logs from Jira, ScriptRunner, and Ambassadors.
    - Running and testing scripts in the Script Console (ScriptRunner).

## Analytical Approach and Logic-Based Diagnosis

In addition to my experience in Atlassian administration, I possess strong programming skills, which allow me to:

    - Analyze and understand complex scripts, conditions, validators, and automations.
    - Accurately identify the exact point where an error originates within a process, workflow, or script.
    - Anticipate the correct diagnostic path from the ticket description, significantly reducing resolution times.
    - Avoid rework and streamline investigations in cases involving multiple tools (Jira, JSM, Confluence, Assets, Xray, ScriptRunner, etc.).

This combination of `administrative and technical skills` expedites each stage of support, allowing me to maintain optimal response times and a resolution rate well above average.

This approach is `one of the main reasons` why I have resolved more than `8,500 tickets`, ranking first in the number of closed cases within the team.
