# 🧠 Advanced Atlassian Skills

**High-level technical expertise across Jira, JSM, Confluence, Assets, Xray & ScriptRunner.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

I provide specialized support across the entire Atlassian ecosystem, combining **advanced administration, technical troubleshooting**, and **deep product knowledge**.
My experience includes handling **8,500+ tickets**, consistently ranking **#1 in resolved cases**, and supporting complex production environments with high reliability.

I’m often the person teams reach when the issue is **unclear, complex, or cross-tool.**

    - Webhooks & integrations
    - Advanced automations (smart values, branches, conditions)

**📮 Jira Service Management**

    - Full portal & request type configuration
    - SLA setup, queues, and troubleshooting
    - Assets expert: schemas, relationships, AQL, validations
    - Notification Helper diagnostics

**📘 Confluence**

    - Xray imports (Tests, Sets, Executions, Plans)
    - Assets imports (JSON/CSV mapping, incremental sync)
    - Fixing broken or inconsistent client files
    - Ensuring clean, validated, production-ready data

**🐞 Troubleshooting & Diagnostics**

    - Audit logs, workflow histories, ScriptRunner logs
    - Script Console testing (safe execution paths)
    - Reproducing issues in dev environments
    - Reindexing management
    - Cross-tool debugging (Jira + Assets + Xray + SR)

**🧩 Marketplace Apps Mastery**

**ScriptRunner** (listeners, behaviors, fragments, post-functions, REST endpoints)  
**Projectrack, Xray, Comala, Elements Connect, EazyBI,**  
and other advanced plugins

**🔐 Users, Permissions & Governance**

## 🧠 My Approach: Logic-Driven Support

I combine **admin expertise + programming logic**, enabling me to:

    - Pinpoint the exact root cause behind complex issues
    - Navigate multi-app dependencies
    - Read & interpret scripts (validators, conditions, behaviors)
    - Predict the correct diagnostic path from the ticket description
    - Avoid rework and accelerate incident resolution

This efficiency is part of what allowed me to reach **8,500+ resolved tickets** with top performance.

## 📈 Impact

    - Faster, more accurate incident resolution
    - Fewer escalations due to deep technical analysis
    - Stable Atlassian ecosystem for internal teams
    - Improved collaboration with vendors
    - Clean, consistent data flows across tools
