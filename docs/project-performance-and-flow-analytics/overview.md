import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::info
**Project Performance & Flow Analytics** is an advanced dashboard installed as a *Project Page* within each project. It is not global, does not require special permissions, and is available to any user with access to the project.
:::

This dashboard transforms your issues into **real-world performance, flow, and efficiency metrics**—no configuration, no administrators, and no reliance on specific agile frameworks. Gain insights that typically require **two or more apps**… now from a single view.

# 🌟 Why this app?

## The problem Jira can't solve alone

:::danger
Jira doesn't show how long an issue spends in each state.
To find out, you have to review the history, add up transitions, and repeat this for each issue.
This makes it **impossible** to measure bottlenecks.
:::

### The main pain points:
- You can't detect real delays in your workflow.
- There's no quick way to see how many days an issue has been in *To Do*, *In Progress*, or *Review*.
- Manually analyzing 20+ issues is impractical.
- Native metrics depend on Scrum or Story Points.
- Other apps require complex configurations and administrator privileges.
- Reviewing the history of an issue with many changes is slow and error-prone.

:::success
**The app automatically analyzes all issues.** 

**It requires no setup, uses no sprints, and doesn't depend on agile frameworks.**
:::

✔ Works for any type of project  
✔ Calculates actual flow metrics, not estimates    
✔ Available to all users (like a board)

## 3. 🔎 Flow Metrics Overview — *Identify real bottlenecks*

Discover what's holding up your workflow:

- **Main bottleneck (Dominant state)**
- **Most frequent state**
- **Average states per issue**
- **Comparison of average vs. maximum duration per state**
- **Distribution of issues by state (horizontal bars)**
- **Detailed list of times per state per issue**

:::note
This data makes it possible to clearly see where the team is investing the most time and where to optimize.

## 4. 🕘 Issue History Explorer — *The easiest history to read in Jira*
An essential tool for support, QA, and in-depth analysis.

✔ Search for any issue by key  
✔ View all changes sorted  
✔ Filter by field  
✔ Ideal for audits or debugging    

:::info
Thanks to field filtering, you can review only what matters (for example: *status*, *assignee*, *priority*). This avoids reading hundreds of lines of the native history.
